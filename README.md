# Real-world graphs

Implementation of several useful algorithms for the course on real-world graphs at ENSTA Paris.

Some topics covered are:
 * Lower bound of the diameter with a breadth-first search.
 * Listing of triangles.
 * k-core decomposition.
 * PageRank.
 * Community detection with label propagation.
